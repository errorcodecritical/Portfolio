Hey there stranger! My name is Toby and I'm a self-taught computer and embedded systems programmer, Electrical and Computer Engineering student and full-time nerd.

This website is intended to serve as a blog/portfolio for my ~~unfinished~~ work. If you would like to get in touch, feel free to contact me via discord **@codecritical**.
